Background Information
=========================
This is one of the more complex projects I did for my data structures course. It's a simulation that simply shows customers coming and checking out at a register (think Walmart/supermarket registers). A user can set the parameters for the program then run the simulation and it'll try and estimate the maximum queue from all of the registers. This primarily demonstrates priority queues and events. The example images show the program's menu and simulation running. 

What language(s) were used?
=========================
C#
